Stretch Goals
-changing the colour of the background depending on the temperature
- look through the res object to see what other features I can import
- add a search bar so you can search other places weather/have a list of capital citys


- be able to click on the celsius and change it to fahrenhite. it already comes in fahrenhite, just need to change the textContent. ✅
  - add an event listener for the click of the temperature-section ✅
  - when the temperature-section is clicked it will show fahrenhite, when pushed again returns to celsius✅
